Model parameters and Hyperparameters

What is the Difference Between a Parameter and a Hyperparameter?
**What is a Model Parameter?**
A model parameter is a configuration variable that is internal to the model and whose value can be estimated from data.

**They are required by the model when making predictions.
They values define the skill of the model on your problem.
They are estimated or learned from data.
They are often not set manually by the practitioner.
They are often saved as part of the learned model.**



Parameters are key to machine learning algorithms. They are the part of the model that is learned from historical training data.


**In classical machine learning literature, we may think of the model as the hypothesis and the parameters as the tailoring of the hypothesis to a specific set of data.**

Often model parameters are estimated using an optimization algorithm, which is a type of efficient search through possible parameter values.

Some examples of model parameters include:

The weights in an artificial neural network.
The support vectors in a support vector machine.
**The coefficients in a linear regression or logistic regression.**
