gini impurity:
Gini Impurity is a measurement of the likelihood of an incorrect classification of a new instance of a random variable,
if that new instance were randomly classified according to the distribution of class labels from the data set.

gini impurity is calculated as :

p(i)*1-p(i) + p(1-i)*1-p(1-i)
